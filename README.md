If you're looking for an automated browser tool focused on bypassing website bot detection mechanisms, I can personally recommend [**Scrapeless Scraping Browser**](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/product/scraping-browser?utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=vinyzu). It's suitable for tasks like web scraping, automated testing, and data collection ‚Äî especially in scenarios that involve complex anti-bot systems.  </br>
[**Scraping Browser**](https://app.scrapeless.com/passport/login?utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=vinyzu) is a cloud-based browser platform built for high-concurrency web scraping and AI automation.

It supports one-click scraping of single pages or entire websites, and can extract content based on prompts. It offers an efficient, stable, and cost-effective solution for large-scale data collection.   </br>  </br>
**Key Features:**

* **High-concurrency scraping support**: Instantly launch 50‚Äì10,000+ browser instances with no server restrictions  
* **Bypass anti-bot mechanisms**: Automatically handles reCAPTCHA, Cloudflare, WAF, DataDome, and more  
* **Highly human-like browsing environment**: Dynamic fingerprint spoofing and simulation of real user behavior  
* **70M+ residential IP proxies**: Global coverage with geo-targeting and automatic rotation  
* **Real-time debugging and session replay**: Built-in Session Inspector and Live View for real-time browser session monitoring and control  
* **Low operating costs**: Proxy usage costs just $1.26‚Äì$1.80/GB

## Install it from PyPI

```bash
pip install botright
playwright install
```

---

## Usage

### Botright is currently only available in async mode.
### It is fully plugable with your existing playwright code. You only have to change your browser initialization!

```py
import asyncio

import botright


async def main():
    botright_client = await botright.Botright()
    browser = await botright_client.new_browser()
    page = await browser.new_page()

    # Continue by using the Page
    await page.goto("https://google.com")

    await botright_client.close()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Browser Stealth

Botright uses a vast amount of techniques to hide its functionality as a bot from websites.
To enhance stealth, since Version 0.3, it uses a real Chromium-based browser from the local machine to start up a botted browser.
For best stealth, you want to install [Ungoogled Chromium](https://ungoogled-software.github.io/ungoogled-chromium-binaries/).

Furthermore, it uses self-scraped [chrome-fingerprints](https://github.com/Vinyzu/chrome-fingerprints) to build up a fake browser fingerprint and to deceive website into thinking it is legit.

## Captcha Solving

Botright is able to solve a wide viarity of Captchas.
For Documentation of these functions visit [BotrightDocumentation](https://github.com/Vinyzu/Botright/blob/main/docs/botright.rst).

It uses Computer Vision/Artificial Intelligence and other Methods to solve these Captchas.

You dont need to pay for any Captcha Solving APIs and you can solve Captchas with just one simple function call.

Here all Captchas supported as of now:

|             Captcha Type             | Supported |            Solved By            | Success Rate |
